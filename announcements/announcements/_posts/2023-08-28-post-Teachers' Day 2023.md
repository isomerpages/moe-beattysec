Beatty Secondary School will be celebrating Teachers' Day on Wednesday, 30 August 2023. Our teachers are our heartbeat. Their steadfast stewardship and indomitable spirit are fundamental to building lives and enabling every child to forge frontiers. 

We invite you to share your notes of appreciation with your childâ€™s teachers using this [padlet](https://go.gov.sg/btytd23). Your words would serve to affirm the heart-work of our teachers. 

Ex-students, please feel free to come by to visit your teachers (ensure you register at the guard post first) from 12:00 to 1:00 pm.
