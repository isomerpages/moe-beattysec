### **Student Management Overview**
##### **The Discipline Philosophy**
Beatty Secondary School’s discipline approach and processes are based on Restorative Practices (RP) which focus on strengthening relationships. RP encourages the individual to reflect on his/her actions and how the actions impact the self and others. In this way, the individual learns the importance of respect, responsibility and positive relationships.

The objective is to instill self-discipline in every Beattyian to be capable of managing himself/herself well and interacting with others in a respectful, responsible and considerate manner.

* Respect oneself and others
