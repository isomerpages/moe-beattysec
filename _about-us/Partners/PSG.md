### **Welcome to Beatty PSG**

##### **Parents Support Group (PSG)**
Beatty Secondary School believes in engaging stakeholders to support the school in delivering holistic education to our students and seeks to develop **effective partnerships** with our key stakeholders. The school taps and leverages on its stakeholders to **maximise educational impact** and **enhance resources.**

The PSG allows parents to opt for greater involvement in school. While providing opportunities for parents who are enthusiastic to contribute to the school by participating in and supporting our school events, the PSG also gives parents a platform to network with other parents in their parenting endeavour.

The collaboration between the PSG and the school opens up more learning opportunities for our students. Parents with professional expertise can offer students advice and exposure to new knowledge, thus adding value to the holistic Beatty experience of their children.

The PSG also enables the school to identify and respond to issues of interest to parents. It provides a channel for parents to raise issues and concerns, seek clarification on decisions, resolve problems and give constructive feedback to the school. This, in turn, creates a more positive relationship between parents and the school.

We firmly believe that we will add value to our students’ school experience as we work together as a team. We look forward to having more parents to come on board the PSG.
