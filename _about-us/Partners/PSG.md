<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>We are a group of parents who believed that a thriving school community
is built on the active involvement and support of parents. We aim to create
a supportive environment that focuses on the following pillars:</p>
<p><strong>1. Engage Parents in Personal Well-being:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We understand that a healthy and happy parent contributes significantly
to a child's overall well-being. Through informative sessions, resources,
and discussions, we strive to empower parents with the tools and knowledge
to take care of their personal wellness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Encourage Parent-Child Bonding:</strong>
</p>

development. Our group organises events and activities that foster positive
interactions between parents and their children, creating lasting memories
and strengthening the family unit.</p>
