### **Empowering Families Through Family Matters@School!**
Because FAMILY matters! Beatty Secondary School believes that the family is the anchor in our lives. In our attempt to support every Beattyian and his or her family, the school partners with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to provide educational programmes and resources.

Family Matters@School (FMS) is a school-based programme that seeks to help parents and students enhance the quality of family life by equipping them with the skills and confidence to build strong relationships. FMS programmes include parenting talks and workshops which provide bonding opportunities for the parents and their children. All sessions are conducted by trained instructors and professional counsellors.

To further support parents, the school has embarked on the Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) under FMS since 2016. This programme has proven effective in improving children's behaviour and reducing parenting stress. With its implementation, all Secondary 1 and 2 parents received an invitation package from the school in January every year seeking input on their parenting needs.

Parents who wish to know more about Triple P and FMS programmes may contact the school.

Thus far, parents who have attended the sessions have given positive feedback.
