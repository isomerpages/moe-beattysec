<h1><strong>Empowering Families ThroughFamily Matters@School!</strong></h1>
<p>Because FAMILY matters! Beatty Secondary School believes that the family
is the anchor in our lives. In our attempt to support every Beattyian and
his or her family, the school partners with the Ministry of Social and
Family Development to provide educational programmes and resources.</p>
<p>Family Matters@School (FMS) is a school-based programme that seeks to
help parents and students enhance the quality of family life by equipping
them with the skills and confidence to build strong relationships. FMS
programmes include parenting talks and workshops which provide bonding
opportunities for the parents and their children. All sessions are conducted
by trained instructors and professional counsellors.</p>
<p>To further support parents, the school has embarked on the Positive Parenting
Programme (Triple P) under FMS since 2016. This programme has proven effective
in improving children's behaviour and reducing parenting stress. With its
implementation, all Secondary 1 and 2 parents received an invitation package
from the school in January every year seeking input on their parenting
needs.</p>
<p>Parents who wish to know more about Triple P and FMS programmes may contact
the school. Thus far, parents who have attended the sessions have given
positive feedback.</p>
