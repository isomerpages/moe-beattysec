<p>Dear fellow Beattyians,</p>
<p>Greetings and welcome to our Beatty Alumni Website. How swiftly time has
flown! Beatty Secondary School and the Beatty Alumni celebrated their 65th
and 25th years of founding respectively in 2018.</p>
<p>15th&nbsp;June was the date of Beatty Alumni’s 26th Annual General Meeting
with the agenda including election of Management Committee for term 2019
to 2021.</p>
<p>Another milestone was reached in our Alumni history when I was re-elected
as the first female president to lead the Beatty Alumni Management Committee
(BAMC) for 4 consecutive terms, from 2013 to 2021.</p>
<p>The committee line up is appended with their names, cohort and photos.</p>
<p>This prestigious honour is indeed a blessing and motivating force for
me to work even more closely with the BAMC team and key stakeholders in
steering our alma mater to greater heights.</p>
<p>It is notable that we have a balanced mix of senior and junior BA members
in the committee. We have Mr Mun Chor Seng from the Pioneer Generation,
Patrick, Michael, Lawrence and myself from the Merdeka generation , as
well as BA Life members from 1990 &amp; 1980s – Katheryn Tan and Brixton
Jeou as well as the millennial cohort – Cheryl and Rafiee.</p>
<p>The success of the BAMC is made possible with strong support from key
stakeholders, namely past and present School Leaders, the School Advisory
Committee, Beatty Alumni comrades and last but not least, the teaching
and non-teaching staff of Beatty.</p>
<p>Special mention goes to our Patron, Mr Low Cheng Lum for his unwavering
and generous support. He has contributed to the establishment of the Low
Cheng Lum Annual Scholarship Award and financially supported in students’
academic development. In addition, he has also generously sponsored many
events, such as the school’s 65th and alumni’s 25th Silver Jubilee celebration
events, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Since its humble inauguration in 1993, our Alumni has come a long way
in nurturing comradeship and the Beatty Family spirit since&nbsp;<strong>yesterday</strong>,
which remains&nbsp;<strong>today</strong>&nbsp;and will certainly flourish&nbsp;<strong>tomorrow</strong>.</p>
<p><em>We will always do our best to bring glory to Beatty. <br>Non Vi Sed Arte – Not with Force, but with Skill!</em>
