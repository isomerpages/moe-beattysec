<p>Dear Fellow Beattyians,</p>
<p>Thirty-two years ago, Mr Bob Fang, our Alumni First President, planted
a seed of fellowship that has since blossomed into something far greater
than any of us could have imagined. Today, as I reflect on our journey
since 1993, I am struck not by how far we have traveled, but by how deeply
our roots have intertwined with the very essence of what it means to be
Beattyian.</p>
<p>We are more than alumni. We are living testament to a truth our school
has always known: that within each Beattyian lies latent gifts that, given
opportunities, and time, can ignite brilliant flames of purpose. Our Alumni
exists not merely to reminisce about yesteryears, but to ensure that every
current and future Beattyian discovers, uncovers, and perhaps recovers
his/her potential to become purpose-driven stewards.</p>
<p>Our motto, Fellowship and Interaction, speaks to something profound. In
a world increasingly fractured by division, we choose connection. In an
age where digital connections often replace genius relationships, and individual
achievement often overshadows collective contribution, we embody Ubuntu:
I am because we are. This is not sentiment; this is our lived practice.</p>
<p>Through the visionary generosity of our first Patron, Mr Low Cheng Lum,
and the continued dedication of alumni like Mr Jimmy Soon, Ms Janet Yeong,
Mr Satianathan, Ms Rajeshwari Rai, the Hee family, Mr Loganathan, and countless
others, we have created a constellation of support that illuminates pathways
for our students. These awards and scholarships are not mere recognition;
they are investments in futures we may never see but will certainly shape.</p>
<p>Our partnership with the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group,
and the school leadership forms an unbreakable nexus, strengthing our shared
commitment to nuture the Beatty spirit for generations to come. Together,
we create spaces where adaptive thinkers emerge, where agile learners flourish,
and where active contributors are born. We do this not because it is expected,
but because it is essential. Each career talk, each mentoring session,
each moment of guidance we provide is our way of paying forward the gifts
Beatty gave us.</p>
<p>As we approach our 33rd year, I see both challenge and opportunity. The
world our current students will inherit demands more than academic excellence.
It requires individuals who can navigate complexity with wisdom, embrace
change with courage, and contribute with compassion. Our role is to bridge
the wisdom of experience with the energy of youth, ensuring that the Beattyian
spirit not only endures but evolves.</p>
<p>To our senior alumni: your stories are our foundation. To our recent graduates:
your energy is our future. To those who have yet to join us: remember that
once a Beattyian, always a Beattyian. Come back not just for fellowship,
but to serve. Come back not just to remember, but to build. Come back because
the next generation of Beattyians deserves to stand on shoulders even stronger
than the ones that lifted us.</p>
<p>The invitation is simple yet profound: be part of something larger than
yourself. Join us in ensuring that every Beattyian who walks through those
familiar gates discovers not just knowledge, but purpose; not just skills,
but wisdom; not just success, but significance.</p>
<p>Together, we continue to build lives and forge frontiers. Together, we
ensure that Beatty's light shines ever brighter.</p>
<p>Non Vi Sed Arte.</p>
