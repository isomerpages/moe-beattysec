### **Direct School Admission – Sec (DSA-Sec) for 2024**

We invite all interested 2023 Primary 6 students to apply for Beatty Secondary School via the DSA-Sec Exercise.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, while keeping in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes that are available to develop their potential and talents.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent area they are selected for from Year 1 – 4.
