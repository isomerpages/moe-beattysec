<h3><strong>Direct School Admission – Sec (DSA-Sec) for 2024</strong></h3>
<p>DSA-Sec seeks to broaden the recognition of talents and achievements beyond
academic grades. P6 students can gain direct entry to certain secondary
schools based on their talent in sports, CCAs and specific academic areas,
etc, before taking the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools based on the student’s
aptitudes and strengths, while keeping in mind the schools’ academic and
non-academic requirements, and the programmes that are available to develop
their potential and talents.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities
related to the talent area they are selected for from Year 1 – 4.</p>
