### **Parents Gateway**
Parents Gateway is an initiative by MOE to enable parents with SingPass to interact with schools more conveniently on administrative matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated on school’s programme and activities.

Through this app, Parents will be able to:

*   Access all your official school announcements and consent forms at your fingertips
*   Give consent for your child's activities anytime, anywhere
*   Receive official announcements directly from schools
*   Keep track of upcoming activities for multiple children
