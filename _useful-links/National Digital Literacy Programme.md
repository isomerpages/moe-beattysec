### **National Digital Literacy Programme**
At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. Throughout their educational journey, students will be able to acquire digital skills across four components in the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework.

One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.		 

##### **Personal Learning Device (PLD)**
Beatty Secondary School has selected the Apple iPad 10.2" (Enhanced Bundle) for Teaching & Learning.

The Enhance Bundle includes 3 year Apple Care+ & 3 year Insurance.

Each PLD bundle will come with the Apple Pencil (1st Generation) & Logitech Keyboard Case (Ruggedized Combo 3).
