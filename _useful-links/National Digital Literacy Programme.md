<h3><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme</strong></h3><p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy.</p><p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p><h4><strong>The PLD Initiative</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="PLD Info" src="/images/PLD_Info.png"></div><p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p><h4><strong>School-Prescribed PLD Bundle</strong></h4><p><em>Updated: December 2023</em></p><p>Beatty Secondary School has selected the Apple iPad 10.9” 10th Generation (Enhanced Bundle) for Teaching &amp; Learning.</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>The Enhance Bundle includes 3 year Apple Care+ &amp; 3 year Insurance.</p></li><li><p>Each PLD bundle will come with the Apple Pencil (USB-C) &amp; Logitech Keyboard Case (Ruggedized Combo 4).</p></li></ul><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Ipad 10th Gen Bundle" src="/images/ipad_Enhance_bundle.png"></div><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Price</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Item</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Price</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Apple iPad 10.9" 64GB, Wi-Fi (2022)<br><em>with 3-year Apple Care+ for Schools &amp; 3-year insurance</em></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>$713.00</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Apple Pencil (1st Generation)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>$97.00</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Logitech Keyboard Case (Ruggedized Combo 4)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>$131.00</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Total (without GST)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>$941.00</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>(Total with GST)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>$1025.60</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Warranty &amp; Insurance</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Insurance Coverage<br><em>Damage to or loss of device from the following which are non-manufacturer defects or internal mechanical faults:</em> <br><br>a.
