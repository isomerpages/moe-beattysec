<h1><strong>After-School Engagement Programme</strong></h1>
<p>The After-School Engagement programme in Beatty Secondary is a structured
programme designed to provide students with enriching activities and support
beyond regular school hours. We offer a variety of activities, including
academic support, arts, sports, life skills, and social development opportunities.
The aim is to create a safe, supportive environment where students can
explore their interests, develop new skills, and engage in positive interactions
with peers and mentors, thereby strengthening their connection to the school.</p>
<p>The ASE Programme seeks to achieve the following objectives:-</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To contribute to overall efforts in building a caring school culture and
safe environment for students to interact and build strong positive relationships,
and a greater sense of school connectedness and belonging.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To extend and continually promote the culture of care after curriculum
hours for students who are vulnerable or have issues with school disengagement.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide a safe and supportive platforms for meaningful activities,
self-study and recreation after curriculum hours, and where developmental
opportunities are available for students to build Social and Emotional
(SE) competencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Part of the ASE Programme is the Cabin Synnergy@Beatty. There is a drop-in
centre, within the school compound, for students to chill with their friends
after school hours. Students have access to a variety of facilities and
equipment, such as fusball tables, pool table, PS 5 consoles and board
games.</p>
<p>Activities/programmes are designed to be engaging and meaningful with
the aim to meet students’ Social and Emotional (SE) needs, as well as to
enhance students’ SE competencies. Students in the target group are given
opportunities and guided to take the lead in various aspects of the running
of activities/programmes. For example, students assist in the planning
&amp; execution of various activities/competitions for their schoolmates.</p>
