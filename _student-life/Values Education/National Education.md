<h1><strong>National Education</strong></h1>
<p>The purpose of National Education is to develop national cohesion, the
instinct for survival and confidence in the future by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fostering a sense of identity, pride and self-respect in being Singaporeans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relating the Singapore story: how Singapore succeeded against all odds
to become a nation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding Singapore’s unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities,
which make us different from other countries; and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instilling the core values of our way of life and the will to prevail,
all of which ensure our continued success and well-being</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The underlying framework for our National Education Programme is based
on the ‘Head, Heart, Hands Framework’.</p>

<p>In engaging the “Head”, students should be actively involved in their
own learning; beyond knowing, they should think through issues and arrive
at a deeper understanding of the challenges facing Singapore and what it
means to be Singaporean.</p>
<p>In engaging the “Heart”, students should connect emotionally with the
Singapore story; their love for the nation should be the outcome of their
appreciating Singapore and having a deeper sense of belonging.</p>
<p>In engaging the “Hands”, students should have opportunities to give back
to society, and realise that everyone has a part to contribute to and create
Singapore’s future, and, where possible, to lead in different fields of
society.</p>
<h3><strong>The 5 NE messages</strong></h3>
<p>1. Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong.
<br><em>We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life.</em>
</p>
<p>2. We must preserve racial and religious harmony.
<br><em>We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility.
<br><em>We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. No one owes Singapore a living.
<br><em>We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. We must ourselves defend Singapore.
<br><em>We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. We have confidence in our future.
<br><em>United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves, and to progress together as one nation.</em>
