<h1><strong>Applied Learning Programme</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>BEATTYIANS THINK. CREATE. INNOVATE</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Our Beliefs</strong></h4>
<p>At Beatty Secondary School, nurturing Thinkers, Learners and Contributors
takes centre stage in our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) with a focus
on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).
<br>Beyond imparting content knowledge and skills such as coding, we strongly
belief in inculcating values that will prepare our students for the future.
Through our programme, undergirded by Design Thinking, a design methodology
to develop creative strategies to resolve pressing issues, our students
can uncover innate talents and abilities, promote ingenuity as well as
develop resilience that are invaluable life skills.</p>
<h4><strong>Embracing the Future Digital World with a Design Mindset</strong></h4>
<p>In line with Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, part of the programme develops
digital literacy in students with an exposure to coding and basic computing
knowledge.&nbsp; This will equip them with sound foundation to prepare
them to embrace and ride the wave of the digital world.&nbsp; To complement
the coding skills, our students are guided to adopt a design mindset, focusing
on solutions in creating an outcome of choice through project-based learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Head, Heart and Hand Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Our programme adopts the Head, Heart and Hand approach to encourage students
to think, create and innovate with experiential learning through the projects
that they embark on.&nbsp; It is imperative that besides developing critical
thinking and problem-solving skills, we instil the value of empathy in
students.
<br>The emphasis of projects is guided by this learning goal and aimed at
‘Smart Living’ to ease day-to-day issues faced by people in the community.</p>
