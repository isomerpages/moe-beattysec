<h1><strong>Hearing Loss Support Programme at Beatty Secondary School</strong></h1>
<p>As a designated mainstream secondary school for supporting students with
hearing loss via the signing approach, Beatty Secondary School offers a
seamless continuum of educational and community support.</p>
<p>Since 2017, we have welcomed students with mild to profound hearing loss
from all schools.</p>
<p>Our support programme focuses on three key areas:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Customised Learning Experience</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promoting Inclusivity</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fostering Independence</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Customised Learning Experience</strong></h3>
<p>At Beatty Secondary School, we provide a tailored learning experience
for students with hearing loss. Our dedicated team of Hearing Loss Resource
Teachers (HL RTs), who are proficient in sign language, work closely with
form teachers, subject teachers, the Student Development Team, and parents.
Together, they ensure that students receive the necessary academic and
socio-emotional support.</p>
<p>To further enhance their learning, students participate in reinforced
learning sessions with HL RTs. We also offer enriched experiential learning
through various programmes, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The English Language Programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NUS-CAPT (College of Alice and Peter Tan) Mentoring Programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrichment Workshops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Sports Competitions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we provide specialised support for school and national examinations
to ensure our studentsâ€™ success.</p>
<h3><strong>Promoting Inclusivity</strong></h3>
<p>At Beatty Secondary School, we believe that every child matters. We raise
awareness of the challenges faced by the hearing loss community and celebrate
the strengths of our students through our Deaf Awareness Programme. This
helps foster a supportive and inclusive environment for all.</p>
<h3><strong>Fostering Independence</strong></h3>
<p>We aim to develop our students into purpose-driven, independent stewards.
By integrating hearing assistive technologies, such as frequency modulation
systems and speech-to-text applications, we empower our students to take
control of their learning.</p>
<p>They are also encouraged to be self-directed in both the classroom and
in their CCAs.</p>
<p>We are proud that many of our students with hearing loss have gone on
to higher education, pursuing diplomas in fields such as Architecture and
IT Systems &amp; Networking. They have also successfully secured employment
after completing their tertiary education.</p>
