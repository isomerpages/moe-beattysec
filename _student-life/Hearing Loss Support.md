<h1><strong>Hearing Loss Support Programme at Beatty Secondary School</strong></h1>
<p>As a designated mainstream secondary school for supporting students with
hearing loss via the signing approach, Beatty Secondary School offers a
seamless continuum of educational and community support.</p>
<p>Since 2017, we have welcomed students with mild to profound hearing loss
from all schools.</p>
<p>Our support programme focuses on three key areas:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Customised Learning Experience</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promoting Inclusivity</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fostering Independence</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Customised Learning Experience</strong></h3>
<p>At Beatty Secondary School, we provide a tailored learning experience
for students with hearing loss. We have a dedicated team of Specialised
Teachers (SpTs) and Educational Interpreters (EIs) from SADeaf (Singapore
Association of the Deaf), who are proficient in SgSL (Singapore Sign Language).
They work closely with the form teachers, subject teachers, the Student
Development Team, and parents. Together, they ensure that students receive
the necessary academic and socio-emotional support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To reinforce their learning, SpTs and EIs arrange supplementary sessions
with the students to revisit the concepts and skills they were supposed
to have learnt in the classroom.&nbsp;We also offer varied enrichment programmes
that focus on experiential learning, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The English Language Programme (to help our students level up their literacy
skills)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NUS-CAPT (College of Alice and Peter Tan) Mentoring Programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drama and/or Dance Workshops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play Inclusive</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we provide specialised support for school and national examinations
to ensure our students’ success.</p>
<h3><strong>Promoting Inclusivity</strong></h3>
<p>At Beatty Secondary School, we believe that every child matters. We raise
awareness of the challenges faced by the hearing loss community and celebrate
the strengths of our students through our Deaf Awareness Programme. This
helps foster a supportive and inclusive culture.</p>
<h3><strong>Fostering Independence</strong></h3>
<p>We aim to develop our students into independent, purpose-driven stewards.
By integrating hearing assistive technologies, such as frequency modulation
systems and speech-to-text applications, we empower our students to take
control of their learning.</p>
<p>They are also encouraged to be self-directed in both the classroom and
in their CCAs.</p>
<p>We are proud that many of our students with hearing loss have gone on
to higher education, pursuing diplomas in fields such as Architecture and
IT Systems &amp; Networking. They have also successfully secured employment
after completing their tertiary education.</p>
