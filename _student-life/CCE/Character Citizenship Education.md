<h3><strong>Character Citizenship Education</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Vision</strong></h5>
<p>To nurture Beattyians of outstanding character who are gracious citizens,
empowered to lead and serve anchored on our school values of integrity,
commitment, care, confidence and creativity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Character Citizenship Education (CCE) is an integrated programme encompassing
CCE lessons from MOE, which incorporates modules for Cyber Wellness, Sexuality
Education, Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) and Social Skills. In
addition, we foster in our students a strong sense of social responsibility
through a variety of community service projects as well as environmental
care programmes. Through this CCE programme, Beattyians develop the skills,
values, attitudes and build emotional connectedness and relationship to
become more confident individuals and active contributors, living life
with passion and a sense of purpose.</p>
<h5><strong>Model of Character and Citizenship Education Programme</strong></h5>
<p>The ‘HEAD’, ‘HEART’ and ‘HAND’ model is the underlying structure of our
CCE Programme and we actively impart the school’s core values and social
emotional competencies, engage students’ emotions in wanting to do the
right thing and provide opportunities for them to practise the acquired
skills and values.</p>
<h5><strong>CCE Theme by level and Level Outcomes</strong></h5>
<p>Our programmes are aligned with each level’s theme to develop our students
progressively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curriculum time is every Wednesday and on some Thursdays. (one hour per
lesson)</p>
