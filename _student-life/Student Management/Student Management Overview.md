<h1><strong>Student Management Overview</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>The Discipline Philosophy</strong></h3>
<p>Beatty Secondary School’s discipline approach and processes are based
on Restorative Practices (RP) which focus on strengthening relationships.
RP encourages the individual to reflect on his/her actions and how the
actions impact the self and others. In this way, the individual learns
the importance of respect, responsibility and positive relationships.</p>
<p>The objective is to instill self-discipline in every Beattyian to be capable
of managing himself/herself well and interacting with others in a respectful,
responsible and considerate manner.</p>
