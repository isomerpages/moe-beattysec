<p>Beatty Secondary School adopts a positive and proactive approach to discipline,
recognizing the importance of fostering students' readiness and motivation
to learn while ensuring they feel safe both physically and emotionally.
We believe that discipline is an educative process, and every student is
gifted with the capacity and ability to self-manage and interact with others
in a respectful and responsible manner.</p>
<p>Guided by our core values—Discipline, Resilience, Empathy, Adaptability,
and Mindfulness—we aim to nurture students who:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Dedicate time and effort for reflection and self-improvement to forge
good habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treat themselves and others with honour, knowing that their words and
actions impact others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete their daily tasks diligently, knowing that small actions accumulate
and enable success</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practise compassion by relating with others, challenge the process, and
align individual and collective needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise open-mindedness and strive to comprehend diverse perspectives
to inspire unity and inclusion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take steps to add value to their environment and those around them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a sense of self-awareness and self-worth, and hold themselves accountable
for their actions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend self-accountability to being responsible to others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise their role in enabling a respectful culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, Beatty Secondary School's discipline approach seeks to
develop students into individuals who are not only self-disciplined but
also empathetic, responsible, and mindful of their impact on others. By
embodying our core values, students are empowered to create a respectful
and inclusive environment, fostering personal growth and contributing positively
to their community.</p>
