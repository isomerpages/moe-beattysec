<h3><strong>How NEXUS@BTY Works</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Interdisciplinary Connections:</strong></h4>

to real-world problems such as environmental issues or technological developments.</p>
<h4><strong>Parallel Curriculum Model (PCM):</strong></h4>
<p>The curriculum is divided into four parallels:</p>
<p>1. Core: Deepen understanding of subject concepts and principles.</p>
<p>2. Connections: Apply knowledge to interdisciplinary, real-world contexts.</p>
<p>3. Practice: Transfer learning directly into practical scenarios.</p>
<p>4. Identity: Build personal values and align with professional communities.</p>
<p>Inclusive Learning:</p>
<p>All students are eligible for NX301/302 modules, with interviews used
for selection, if necessary. Exceptional performance is not required -
curiosity and a growth mindset are key.</p>
