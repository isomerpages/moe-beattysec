<h1><strong>Discover NEXUS@BTY</strong></h1>
<p>What if we ventured beyond our books and classrooms – what might learning
look like? What if we could transcend and connect across disciplines, subjects,
cultures or even places? What if we could inspire deepening of knowledge
and skills through social, practical, intentional, cognitive and emotional
engagement?</p>
<p>Welcome to NEXUS@BTY, where these ‘what ifs’ become reality.</p>

<p>NEXUS@BTY is more than just a cornerstone programme. It is a journey that
sparks discovery, one that is carefully curated and diligently designed
to equip Beattyians with requisite emerging 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies,
and to ultimately nurture them as Adaptive Thinkers, Agile Learners and
Active Contributors.</p>
