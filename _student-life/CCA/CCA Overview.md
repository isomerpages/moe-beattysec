<h1><strong>CCA</strong></h1>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through
CCA, students discover their interests and talents. CCA also promotes forging
of friendships amongst students from diverse backgrounds as they learn,
play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration
and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility
to school, community and nation.</p>
<p>Each secondary school student must take part in&nbsp;<strong>ONE</strong>&nbsp;CCA
from the following options:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Uniformed Groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual and Performing Arts Group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports &amp; Games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clubs &amp; Societies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students participating in the school band or any of the three National
Uniformed Groups, namely National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Police Cadet
Corps (NPCC), National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), are not permitted
to change his/her CCA throughout their secondary school years, except for
medical reasons.</p>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment
will be recognised.&nbsp;<strong>This recognition will be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/Polytechnics/Institute of Technical Education.</strong>
