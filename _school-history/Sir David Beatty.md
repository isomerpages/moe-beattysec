**Admiral Sir David Beatty (1871 - 1936)**<br>
One of the youngest British admirals in history, David Beatty was a charismatic and courageous leader who fought in most major engagements during the First World War. Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet from 1916-1919 and First Sea Lord for an unprecedented period between 1919-1927, Beatty was one of the most influential figures in the Royal Navy in the early decades of the twentieth century. 

Known for his reputation as a daring commander often in controversial circumstances, he often issued battle instructions emphasising use of initiative and pursuit of the enemy.  As First Sea Lord, he opposed cuts in naval strength and used his high profile and popularity to press the navy's case in government with some success. Convinced the Navy was the first line of Imperial defence, Beatty stressed the need for a strong battlefleet and advocated the construction of a base at Singapore to meet the Japanese threat. On his death in 1936 Beatty was buried in St Paul's cathedral close to Nelson's crypt.
