<h3><strong>RAI CREATIVE EXCELLENCE AWARD</strong></h3>
<p>The Rai Creative Excellence Award is generously sponsored by our alumna,
Ms Rajeshwari Rai. Years ago, within these very halls, Ms Rajeshwari discovered
her own potential through the encouragement of her teacher, Mr Simon Foo.
His simple words, 'You have potential', sparked a transformation in a young
student who had not yet recognised her own capabilities. This award recognises
students who have demonstrated outstanding talent, creativity and/or achievement
in the visual or performing arts. It celebrates their creativity, innovation,
and artistic excellence, reflecting our mission to nurture agile learners
and active contributors. These students exemplify the values of discipline,
resilience, and adaptability, embodying the spirit of purpose-driven stewardship
through their artistic contributions to the school and broader community,
reflecting strong creative, artistic expression. To our award recipients,
Ms Rajeshwari's message resonates deeply: 'I see you. I see your potential.
May your wildest dreams become your reality. And once you become the rising
star I know you will be, I trust you will pay it forward in your creative
endeavours!'</p>
