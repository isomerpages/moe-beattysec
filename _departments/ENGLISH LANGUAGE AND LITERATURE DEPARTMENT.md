<h4>Step into the English Language and Literature Department, where we wield the brushes of imagination and the colours of expression. From sketching narratives in our Creative Writing Programme to exploring the rich tapestry of themes like Food Sustainability in the Parallel Curriculum Model programme, we guide students in crafting their own masterpieces in the written and spoken word. Like skilled artists, we employ strategies such as the "Let's Talk" card game and Edtech tools to mix the brushstrokes of effective communication and critical thinking skills.</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Join us in our studio of words, where every stroke of language adds depth and beauty to the canvas of learning.</h4>
