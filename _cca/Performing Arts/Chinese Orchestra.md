Beatty Secondary School’s Chinese Orchestra has a long history dating back to the 1970s. We strive to develop our members’ interest in Chinese Orchestra music as well as their personal character.  
  
In order to develop our members musically, we provide them with various opportunities to participate actively in both school and public performances, including the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Through these performances, our members develop sportsmanship and self-discipline which are basic attributes in all musicians. In addition, we nurture student leaders by appointing them in various leadership positions. They acquire leadership qualities via the responsibilities they undertake.
