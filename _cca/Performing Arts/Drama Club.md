Beatty Secondary School’s Drama Club aims to provide students with opportunities for creative expression as well as platforms to explore and develop their skills and interest in drama. The rigorous and engaging training programme is designed to develop in students an appreciation and enjoyment of drama as an art form, as well as to build their self-discipline and confidence while fostering team building.  
  
Under the guidance of our passionate and dedicated instructor, students hone their skills and talents for events such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation and the school’s Annual Awards Day concert. To encourage creative self-expression and collaborative learning, students are also trained to work on their own or with their peers to produce and perform their own works.  
  
Besides performing at school events and the SYF Arts Presentations, Drama Club collaborates with the English Language and Literature Department to provide voice talents for the school’s own radio station, heartBEAT. Our radio show goes on air every Tuesday morning. Drama Club deejays keep the student body updated on upcoming events taking place in the school and hot topics from Singapore and around the world.
