Beatty Secondary School’s Malay Dance has been established for more than 20 years, specialising in mainly traditional Malay dances such as the Asli, Inang, Joget and Zapin. One of the objectives of the CCA is to instil confidence in our dancers as they showcase their talent. Furthermore, we want to inculcate the values of commitment and perseverance in them. Various platforms are provided to our dancers to develop their dance abilities and strengths in the performing arts, such as performing for both school and external events. 

In order to inculcate a sense of belonging and ownership amongst our dancers, we decided to give Malay Dance CCA a name and call it _Aswari_, a short form for Anak Seni Warisan Tari (Child of the Malay Dance Legacy). Even though our vibrant group of dancers comprises of students with different racial and cultural backgrounds, we have the same interest and passion in keeping traditional Malay dance alive.
