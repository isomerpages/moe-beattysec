Beatty Secondary School’s Concert Band aims to provide a platform for our budding musicians to develop their musical abilities. We welcome Beattyians who are willing to commit their time to practise and learn how to play a musical instrument. Our band members are exposed to a range of opportunities such as performances within the school as well as exchange programmes and competitions with other schools.  
  
We also aim to stretch our students in their leadership skills by empowering them to plan and organise performances and events for the team. In the long term, we seek to develop a team of musicians and leaders who are passionate about music and possess a deep appreciation and understanding of the arts.
