The Modern Dance CCA aims to groom students to excel in the area of dance. We provide opportunities for students to develop dance techniques and leadership skills by taking part in internal and external competitions and performances. Our dance members are exposed to different dance genres and they undergo training to develop their flexibility and strengthen their core muscles.  
  
Besides developing our students physically through the various dance movements, we also hope to develop their passion for the arts and instill a sense of responsibility and discipline in them.
