### **CCA**
CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents. CCA also promotes forging of friendships amongst students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.

Each secondary school student must take part in **ONE** CCA from the following options:

*   Uniformed Groups
*   Visual and Performing Arts Group
*   Sports & Games
*   Clubs & Societies

Students participating in the school band or any of the three National Uniformed Groups, namely National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), are not permitted to change his/her CCA throughout their secondary school years, except for medical reasons.

At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment will be recognised. **This recognition will be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/Polytechnics/Institute of Technical Education.**
