Beatty Secondary School’s Information and Communication Club (InfoComm Club) aims to equip our members with skills in photography, video production, the use of audio-visual (AV) equipment and simple coding. We hope to nurture members who are able to work confidently as an individual and in a team, who are adaptable and have the self-discipline to put in their best in the tasks they are assigned.  
  
We specialise in the use of AV equipment, photography and videography. In addition, our members are trained in mobile app development which trains computational thinking and prepares members for the skills required for our Smart Nation in the near future.
