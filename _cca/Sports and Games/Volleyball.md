Beatty Secondary School’s Volleyball aims to unite students with a common interest in the sport and develop their teamwork, sportsmanship and communication skills. Playing volleyball also helps to improve their flexibility as well as motor coordination.  
  
The Volleyball team provides many opportunities for our players to bond with one another, such as our annual Bonding Day camp and outing as well as Values-In-Action activities where students are able to contribute to the community at the same time. They are also provided various platforms to stretch their sporting potential and abilities through representing the school in the annual ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions Volleyball Zonal Championships and friendly matches with other schools.  
  
In addition, we take great pride in maintaining our physical fitness and stamina. Therefore, during e-CCA sessions our players continue to engage in physical training and match analysis via Zoom video conferencing.  
  
Volleyball is one of the three Direct School Admission (DSA) CCAs offered by Beatty Secondary School.
