Beatty Secondary School’s Wushu team focuses on character building and skills development. To achieve this aim, we incorporate passion in all our trainings and performances, respect for our coaches, teachers, seniors and one another, as well as dedication to our craft.

There are many opportunities for our members to perform within and outside of school. Over the years, we have produced many outstanding students who have excelled in the National Inter-School Wushu Championships.

Wushu is one of the three Direct School Admission (DSA) CCAs offered by Beatty Secondary School.
