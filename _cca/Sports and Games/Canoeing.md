Beatty Secondary School’s Canoeing Team seeks to mould our Beattyians into young adults who possess not only physical prowess, but also positive character traits.  
  
Every year, the Canoeing Team participates in three competitions: The Singapore Canoe Marathon, The National Junior Canoe Sprint Championships and the National School Canoeing Championships. Through these competitions, our students have the opportunities to display their passion for the sport, sportsmanship, resilience and teamwork. We also provide them with opportunities to take part in various programmes to equip them with vital leadership and life skills.  
  
Canoeing is one of the three Direct School Admission (DSA) CCAs offered by Beatty Secondary School.
