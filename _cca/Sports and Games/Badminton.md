Badminton is an established CCA in Beatty Secondary School. Members in the CCA are taught the proper skills and techniques and they display the school core values throughout their learning process. We place great emphasis on the importance of sportsmanship, be it in a competition or friendly match. We believe that the values are crucial in preparing our Beattyians for the challenges they will face in and out of the court.
