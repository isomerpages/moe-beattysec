Girl Guides in Beatty Secondary School provides opportunities for our Guides to discover and develop their strengths, skills and potential in guiding to the fullest.We aim to develop girls of courage, confidence and character who will make the school and community a better place.

We have a comprehensive Five-Point Programme which enables our Guides to develop in the following five areas:
*   Personal & Social Development
*   Home
*   Outdoor
*   Community
*   International

Working hard to earn their badges helps our Guides to widen their horizon, uncover new talents and learn practical skills that will enrich their lives.

We empower our Guides through fun and challenging programmes, unique experiences, adventures and activities. We offer opportunities for them to be involved in school, division and national Girl Guides events and competitions. These exposures equip them with vital leadership and life skills while learning through fun adventures and forging lifelong friendships with people.
