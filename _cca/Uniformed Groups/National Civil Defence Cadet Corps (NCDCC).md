Our National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) unit aims to provide a purposeful and meaningful journey through which our cadets will be given the chance to learn Civil Defence related lifesaving skills, lead in the CCA and serve the community in various service learning projects. The main objectives of NCDCC are to:

*   Develop and empower our cadets to be active and concerned citizens advocating life-saving skills
*   Provide enriching holistic leadership and character-building experiences
*   Guide our cadets to learn Triangle of Life Skills, which include basic firefighting, first aid and CPR+AED
*   Train our cadets in soft skills such as leadership, communication (including methods of instruction), relationship management and social awareness to get them ready for their leadership phase
*   Nurture and guide cadets to make informed choices to serve the school and the wider community through public education platforms

Regular training sessions occur at the unit level, where our cadets are given the opportunities to train with peers with similar experiences to master the knowledge and skills required for promotion to their next rank. Core NCDCC activities include first aid, foot drills and performing community service. Our cadets also acquire various essential life skills such as fire safety and rescue methods as well as participate in other enrichment and teambuilding activities organised by the unit.
