The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) was formed in 1959 and has become one of the popular youth uniformed organisations in Singapore. Beatty Secondary School was one of the pioneer schools that included NPCC in its list of Co-Curricular Activities when the Corps was first formed.

NPCC’s mission is to develop our cadets to become active citizens and community leaders by working hand in hand with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to fight crime and keep Singapore safe. Through the various programmes and initiatives, our cadets hone their leadership skills and are groomed into leaders with strong character and positive social, moral and civic values.
