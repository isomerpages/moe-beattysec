Over the past few decades, the Beatty Beaver Scouts has produced three Queen’s Scouts and five President’s Scouts. The troop has implemented a systematic training programme which seeks to inculcate self-discipline, hone leadership qualities and ensure teamwork dynamics in our Beaver Scouts. At the end of their four- or five-year journey in Beatty, every Beaver Scout will be well-versed in pioneering and orienteering skills, is fully aware of his personal responsibilities, and is well-informed of the world around him. He should be able to serve his country as a loyal and dedicated citizen equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience. Through our effort in building a strong and committed troop, we have proven that our Beaver Scouts possess the necessary dispositions to manage any challenges they face in life.
