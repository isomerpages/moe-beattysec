Beatty Secondary School’s Boys' Brigade Company was founded in 1975 as the 10th Singapore Company (BB).

There are many opportunities for our Boys to grow physically and socially. Our Boys grow as they plan and carry out the activities organised throughout the year. Through a wide range of activities, the Boys acquire many important life skills. They learn to communicate effectively and organise events, displaying servant leadership in the process.

We organise fun, meaningful and challenging activities such as badges attainment, outdoor activities and community services for our Boys.
