<p>Dear Pupils, Parents and Partners</p>
<p>Welcome to our Beatty Ohana! At Beatty Secondary School, we believe that
within each Beattyian lies latent gifts – a spark of potential that given
the right opportunities and time can ignite a brilliant flame of talent
and purpose, becoming a beacon for others.</p>
<p>Our journey together is one of discovery and growth. In a world where
change is rapid and intense, adaptability is not just an asset; it is a
necessity. We are committed to <strong><em>Nurturing</em></strong>  <strong><em>Adaptive Thinkers, Agile Learners, and Active Contributors</em></strong>.
This mission forms the cornerstone of our approach to education, preparing
our students to shape their futures by navigating their narratives and
discovering their dreams.</p>
<p>At Beatty, we clearly define what adaptive thinking, agile learning and
active contribution look like. Critical, creative and design thinking are
at the core of being adaptive. Beattyians sharpen these skills not just
intellectually, but also by considering the social, emotional and psychological
aspects of any situation. We believe this is crucial in enabling them to
become discerning decision-makers, inventive problem-solvers and empathetic
communicators.</p>
<p>We focus on developing their agility in learning, teaching them not just
what to learn, but <em>how</em> to learn and live. This understanding of
the skill of learning is essential for lifelong growth. We equip Beattyians
with tools to acquire knowledge, apply it meaningfully, and reflect on
their development. Most importantly, we inspire active contribution by
encouraging our students to serve with purpose and add value to their communities.</p>
<p><strong>How then, do we do this?</strong> Each experience, from the core
instructional experience to CCAs is intentionally planned to develop and
nurture our students in a range of areas. Allow me to share three highlights
of the Beattyian Experience.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme</strong> in Machine Learning: Here,
students do not simply learn about technology. We imbue in them ethical
principles that are fundamental to navigating the realm of technology safely
and confidently, and they have opportunities to harness A.I. to create
solutions to real-world challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leading for Life Programme</strong>: Grounded in relatable and
relevant models like the Leadership Challenge (KP Model) and the Joy of
Leadership (SHARP), this tiered and spiralling programme nurtures personal
leadership and stewardship, guiding students to lead self and others with
confidence and integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NEXUS@BTY</strong>: This cohesive and curated collection of activities
is designed to nurture Beattyians to become adaptive thinkers, agile learners
and active contributors. Through a sequence of cross-disciplinary modules,
NEXUS equips students with the skills and dispositions requisite to thrive
in the years beyond their time at Beatty, and is reflective of our commitment
to prepare students for the challenges and opportunities of the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We understand that true education goes beyond academic excellence. It
is about learning how to learn, how to live, and how to love. At Beatty,
we guide our students through this mastery. We teach them to learn how
to regulate and tune in to their emotions, be mindful of their actions,
and respond thoughtfully. We nurture in them the will to care for and contribute
to others, embracing the belief that “I am because we are”.</p>
<p>Our compass for this journey is our <strong>DREAM values – Discipline, Resilience, Empathy, Adaptability and Mindfulness</strong>.
These guide how we shape character, community and culture to attend to
aspirations and purpose, both individually and collectively.</p>
<p>We all want our children to be adept at navigating the complexities of
life, especially in a world where change is intense and rapid. The experiences
they have in school are critical in ensuring that they have the knowledge,
skills, values and dispositions to do just that. At the same time, it is
about enabling them to act, to have a voice, and to understand how rights
and responsibilities go hand-in-hand as citizens.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Beattyian experience is one where we set them on a curriculum
for life, one that will allow them to author their futures and hold them
in good stead long after they leave our halls, not with force, but with
skill.</p>
<p><strong>Be a part of our Ohana</strong> on this exciting odyssey of discovery
and growth. Together, we will enable each child to discover, uncover, and
perhaps recover their potential, becoming the best versions of themselves.
Our children will be adaptive thinkers, agile learners, and active contributors;
purpose-driven stewards who make a lasting impact on those around them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Non Vi Sed Arte.</em></strong>
