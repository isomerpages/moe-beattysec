<p>Dear Pupils, Parents and Partners</p>
<p>Welcome to our Beatty Ohana! At Beatty Secondary, we care for our pupils.
To care is to endeavour to allow for someone to thrive and flourish, and
to become the best versions of themselves; it is a labour of love to allow
others to realise and actualise their potential. We do this by seeing the
whole person, and to work together, as a collective, to achieve aspirations
in a manner that will build the learner for life. This stems from a deep
belief that each child is a gift, and that Beatty is a community that will
allow its learners to discover who they are as they uncover their giftings
through a broad range of learning opportunities and experiences.</p>
<p>Education is about moulding identity and beliefs. This is what guides
and drives us as a community of educators and learners. It is both an intellectual
and an emotional endeavour. At Beatty, we work together to nurture thinking
and emotional competencies that bode well for Beattyians’ future. It is
not just “the what” that needs to be done or “the why”; we are clear about
what these are. It is about “the how”. Paying attention to process, as
it stems from our philosophy and principles, is vital to learning and improving.
This is what we stand for at Beatty: not by force, but by art and skill.
Beattyians will learn how to learn, how to live, and how to care and in
so doing, will develop their sense of purpose and passion for life.</p>
<p>Our engines for actualising these outcomes are the many intentionally
designed programmes for Beattyians to discover and develop their mindsets
and heartsets. Two of these are our ALP and LLP. Critical and Design Thinking
models, and The Leadership Challenge Model, frame our approach to nurturing
deeper learning and purposeful contribution. Through the ALP, Beattyians
will apply STEM to think, create, and innovate. This is an example of how
they use their knowledge to contribute and add value to the community.
Through the LLP, Beattyians will have opportunities to deepen their understanding
about what it means to serve and lead others by engaging in leadership
development opportunities which include forums and overseas exchange programmes
with China, Japan and Vietnam.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a paradigm shift as a learning community and as
a society. There is a need to bring to the fore a different worldview or
zeitgeist, and way of being. It is not just about doing more or many different
things. This again is about skill and art. It is in learning how that we
will afford Beattyians the opportunity to discover who they are as individuals,
and through that, uncover their giftings. It is through learning how to
learn and live that Beattyians will be able to deeply benefit from the
learning opportunities afforded via full subject-based banding, the digital
and blended learning programmes and the suite of programmes designed here
at Beatty. And it is in learning how to care that they will be able to
know what it means to contribute purposefully. It speaks to motivation,
not simplistically management; it is about inclusion above and beyond integration.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I will continue to build on the brilliant work that
has been done by the warm and loving community that is our Beatty Ohana.
We will continue to excel and improve how we develop and engage students
in a curriculum of life, to imbue in them critical, core values that would
give them a strong sense of self and community. We will do this by engendering
curiosity, confidence, courage, and complementarity. This will set every
Beattyian on a curriculum for life, one that we know will hold them in
good stead long beyond their years in school, to think, learn and contribute
purposefully and meaningfully.</p>
