The colours, which are the colours of Admiral Beatty, symbolise unity

The bee-hive, surrounded by buzzing bees, was derived from Admiral Beatty's Coat of Arms. The school crest symbolises hard work that has to be put in for success.

This motto, chosen by&nbsp;**Mr Meyer**, the school's first principal, was taken from the Coat of Arms of Admiral Earl David Beatty after whom the school was named.
