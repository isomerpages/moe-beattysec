<p>In March 1953, the Deputy Director of Education, Mr R.E Ince invited the
Principal of Victoria School, Mr R. F. Bouford, to visit a school building
which was almost ready to be taken over by the Education Department from
PWD.&nbsp; This was situated near the former Rumah Miskin Police Station
along Serangoon Road.&nbsp; The Supervisor of Victoria Continuation School,
Reverend Daniel Elijah Sundram, was asked to accompany them as an interested
party.&nbsp; The school was later named BEATTY SECONDARY SCHOOL.</p>
<p>Beatty Secondary School was officiallly opened on 6 July 1953 by Mr R.
M. Young, the Director of Education.&nbsp; The co-educational school functioned
immediately after the opening ceremony. The morning and afternoon sessions,
however, functioned as different schools.&nbsp; While the morning school
had Mr A.G. Meyer, a Raffles trained teacher, then the Principal of Tampines
Morning School, the afternoon school had Reverend Daniel E. Sundram.</p>
<p>The school began with 323 students in eight classes: 3 Standard Six classes
from Bartley Secondary School and 3 Standard Seven and 2 Standard Eight
Classes from Victoria Continuation School. This was a departure from the
original plan of having only 120 students in Standard Six.</p>
<p>In January 1954, the rest of victoria Continuation School, including the
staff, moved in.&nbsp; In addition, the students from Gan Eng Seng School
and Serangoon Continuation School did likewise.&nbsp; By now, there was
23 classes functioning with 928 students.&nbsp; With such a diverse student
population, the plan then was a ‘one-school’ policy.&nbsp; Subsequently,
internal arrangements were made by Mr A.G. Meyer and Reverend Daniel E
Sundram.&nbsp; Henceforth, the school functioned as one school in the morning
under one single Principal.</p>
<p>The afternoon session was used to accommodate classes from other schools.&nbsp;
In 1956, the afternoon session classes were moved to Kwong Avenue Primary
School.&nbsp; In the same year, the girls were transferred to Cedar Girls’
Secondary School.&nbsp; Beatty Secondary became full fledged all-boy secondary
school.&nbsp; 20 students from Chinese Middle School were also admitted
to the Post School Certificate class.&nbsp; Hence, the beginning of pre-university
education in Beatty Secondary.</p>
<p>The afternoon session was re-introduced to Beatty Secondary in 1960 and
was run as part of the Beatty Secondary School administration.</p>
<p>Over the years, the student population increased significantly.&nbsp;
The old school premises and facilities were inadequate for both the staff
and students.&nbsp; In the late 1970s, Mr Lim Bok Hai, the then school
Principal, initiated the move to larger premises with better facilities.&nbsp;
The old Beatty Secondary School eventually moved to its present premises
in Toa Payoh in March 1982.&nbsp; It was officially opened on 26 July 1983
by Mr Michael Liew, the former Member of Parliament for Boon Teck.&nbsp;
In the same year, girls were re-admitted to Secondary One.&nbsp; The school
saw the graduation of its last batch of Pre-U 3 students in 1991.&nbsp;
From 1992 onwards, it has functioned as a full-co-educational secondary
school. The school turned single session again in 1996. In 1996, the school
had 40 clasess with a total population of 1,500.</p>
