#### Mother Tongue Languages Department

The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department aims to nurture Beattyians to be passionate about their mother tongue language, appreciate the various cultures and be lifelong learners.

##### **MTL Curriculum**
We offer Higher MTL (i.e., Higher Chinese Language (HCL), Higher Tamil Language and Higher Malay Language) to selected students who have a flair for the language. We are also a Higher Chinese Language Centre hosting Sec 1 to 4 HCL classes for students from neighbouring schools.

#### **Key Programmes**

##### **MTL Fortnight**
The MTL Fortnight seeks to create an immersive and engaging environment for students to learn and use their mother tongue language as well as to show appreciation for the three mother tongue languages.

Some of the key programmes and activities organised during the MTL Fortnight include:
-	Lunar New Year Celebration –  Chinese New Year e-Concert and class bonding activities
-	MTL Cultural Camp
-	Activities such as essay writing competition, story telling competition, singing competition, talent show, drama workshops, movies appreciation sessions, language and culture quiz, etc.
-	MTL Oratorical Skills Camp
-	Virtual and/or physical learning journeys
-	Cultural hands-on activities

These fun, meaningful and authentic learning experiences will surely help to deepen our students’ understanding and appreciation of their mother tongue language.

##### **Festive Celebrations**
- ##### **Lunar New Year Celebrations**
This year, the celebration began with class bonding activities where students made paper peonies and used them to decorate the classrooms. Next, the whole school was treated to a virtual concert consisting pre-recorded and livestream segments. The pre-recorded concert items were performed by students from the Chinese Orchestra, Wushu and Modern Dance CCAs. A group of teachers also performed a singing item. One of the highlights of the celebrations was the ‘Beatty Talent Show’ where many of our talented Beattyians performed for the entire school.

- ##### **Hari Raya Celebrations**
Other than language acquisition, the Malay Language Unit believes in deepening students’ understanding of cultural elements through the celebration of festivals. Hari Raya Aidilfitri is traditionally celebrated in our Beatty Ohana through the following activities:
	-	Introduction to Hari Raya songs
	-	Quiz on Hari Raya festivities


- ##### **Deepavali Celebrations**
In order to promote multi-culturalism amongst the school population, the Tamil Language Unit organises the event which celebrates the Festival of Lights every year. The school foyer would boast a rangoli, a beautiful and vividly coloured artwork created out of flour, rice and flower petals. Various fringe activities such as traditional Indian handicraft sessions (e.g., colouring of rangoli art designs, ‘thoranam’ (hanging decorations)) and making and tasting of popular Indian delicacies are also carried out for all students as part of experiential learning.

##### **MTL Reading Programme**
The reading programme is incorporated into the MTL curriculum. This serves as a platform for our students to inculcate the love of reading varied MTL texts which come in the form of newspapers, novels, short stories and articles. MTL teachers seek opportunities to extend students’ learning by discussing these materials during MTL lessons so that they can gain knowledge and find relevance in the materials they read.
