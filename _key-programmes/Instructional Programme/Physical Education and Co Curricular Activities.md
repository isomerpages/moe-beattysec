The Physical Education &amp; Co-Curricular Activities (PE &amp; CCA) Department seeks to equip every Beattyian with the necessary skills, knowledge and attitude in sports to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living.

#### **Programmes**

Through the structured PE lessons and Sports Education Programmes, the PE Department aims to foster a love for sports and promote a healthy lifestyle. Beattyians are exposed to a variety of sports and games, outdoor education as well as physical health and fitness education. Each PE lesson is planned to ensure the psycho-motor, cognitive and affective development of our students.

The CCAs also give students the opportunities to develop specific skills and exhibit their non-academic abilities and passion. Together with the other school programmes, the PE lessons and CCAs contribute to the holistic development of the child.

##### **PE lessons – Sports &amp; Games**

Students will learn how to play the various games in their four or five years of secondary school education. These include:

-	Territorial-invasion games – frisbee, football, netball, floorball
-	Net-barrier games – badminton, volleyball
-	Striking-fielding games – softball

##### **Sports Education Programmes**

The department organises post-examination sports education programmes to increase sporting opportunities for all. Through activities such as tchoukball and handball, we hope to encourage participation in sports in the school and convey the message that sports can be enjoyed by all.

##### **Annual Sporting Events**

Both the staff and students actively participate in sporting activities throughout the year to lead a healthy lifestyle:

-	Annual Cross Country Run at MacRitchie Reservoir
-	All Children Exercise Simultaneously (ACES) Day
-	Sports Carnival
-	Inter-class games
