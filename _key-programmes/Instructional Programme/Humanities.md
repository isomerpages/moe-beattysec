### Humanities Department
![](/images/Our%20People/humanities-department-2.png)

The Humanities, comprising Geography, History, Social Studies and Elements of Business, provide multiple lenses to help students understand the world we live in where globalisation and rapid technological advancements are enhancing the connectedness and interdependency across countries. We equip students with critical thinking, responsible decision making and communication skills as well as global perspectives to become confident people, active contributors and concerned citizens. These skills are crucial in enabling our students to navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing world.

Every student in Beatty Secondary School will develop an appreciation for and interest in the Humanities, and will learn how to read and think analytically, and be equipped with the necessary life skills and knowledge to become critical thinkers.

#### **Programmes**

##### **Critical Thinking Skills through Inquiry and Socratic Questioning**

These teaching strategies across all subjects give students varied learning experiences, cater to the unique learning style of each student and help students become better thinkers, and active and independent learners.

##### **Experiential Learning through local field studies and internationalisation**

Field studies and overseas cultural immersion promote compassionate and engaged learning by providing students with the opportunities to create, innovate and lead in a real-life environment. Cultural awareness of multiple perspectives and character values underpin these programmes.

##### **Humanities Challenge and Model United Nations Conferences**

Competitions like the Geography and History Challenge and conferences like the Model United Nation offer a chance for participants to gain substantial experience, showcase skills, analyse and evaluate outcomes, and uncover personal aptitude. These opportunities also encourage students to adopt innovative techniques and develop their ideas and skills.
