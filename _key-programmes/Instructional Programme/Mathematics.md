### Mathematics Department

The Mathematics Department aims to develop our studentsâ€™ competency and confidence in Mathematics through a rigorous curriculum that emphasises the application of mathematical concepts and skills in problem solving. This is in line with the national emphasis on the application of Mathematics to solve problems in real world contexts. Teaching and learning is differentiated and catered to the needs of our students.

#### **Programmes**

##### **Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest and Singapore Mathematical Olympiad Training Programme**
These competitions provide the platform for students with an interest and inclination in Mathematics to shine. Students who are strong in Mathematics and keen in learning are invited to participate in the training. Through these exposures, our students develop their confidence, aptitude and mastery in Mathematics beyond the standard curriculum.

In the Singapore Math Kangeroo Contest 2021, our students achieved two Silvers, eight Bronzes and eight Honourable Mentions.

##### **Financial Literacy Programme**
We have a fun-filled activity based series of financial literacy workshops planned for Sec 1 to 3 students as part of the mid-year and end-of-year post-examination activities. Our students gain first-hand experience in financial literacy through playing specially designed board games, card games and other interesting role-playing games. Through creative play, our students become more aware of basic financial concepts such as the importance of saving from young, business cycles and investments. They learn to differentiate between needs and wants and learn to be savvy in managing their finances.
