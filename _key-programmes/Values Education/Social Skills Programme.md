### **Social Skills Programme**
In lower secondary level, students are explicitly taught social skills during CCE lessons. We believe that social skills equip students with the skills, knowledge and dispositions to manage themselves, build healthy relationships and make responsible decisions. This helps students to build resilience, achieve better mental well-being, which in turn has positive effects on their learning and overall development. Ultimately, Social skills develop social emotional competencies in students that will help them face future challenges.  
  
The Social Skills Programme are centred on three themes, leading to three outcomes.
