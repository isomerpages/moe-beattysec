### **National Education**
The purpose of National Education is to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in the future by:
*   Fostering a sense of identity, pride and self-respect in being Singaporeans;  
    
*   Relating the Singapore story: how Singapore succeeded against all odds to become a nation;  
    
*   Understanding Singapore’s unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries; and   
    
*   Instilling the core values of our way of life and the will to prevail, all of which ensure our continued success and well-being

The underlying framework for our National Education Programme is based on the ‘Head, Heart, Hands Framework’.

In engaging the “Head”, students should be actively involved in their own learning; beyond knowing, they should think through issues and arrive at a deeper understanding of the challenges facing Singapore and what it means to be Singaporean.  
  
In engaging the “Heart”, students should connect emotionally with the Singapore story; their love for the nation should be the outcome of their appreciating Singapore and having a deeper sense of belonging.  
  
In engaging the “Hands”, students should have opportunities to give back to society, and realise that everyone has a part to contribute to and create Singapore’s future, and, where possible, to lead in different fields of society.
