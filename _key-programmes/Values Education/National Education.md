### **National Education**
The purpose of National Education is to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in the future by:
*   Fostering a sense of identity, pride and self-respect in being Singaporeans;  
    
*   Relating the Singapore story: how Singapore succeeded against all odds to become a nation;  
    
*   Understanding Singapore’s unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries; and   
    
*   Instilling the core values of our way of life and the will to prevail, all of which ensure our continued success and well-being

The underlying framework for our National Education Programme is based on the ‘Head, Heart, Hands Framework’.
