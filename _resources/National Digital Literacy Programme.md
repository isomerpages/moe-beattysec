<p>The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to help students <strong>strengthen their digital literacy and acquire digital skills</strong> needed
to navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p>
<p>Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will <strong>own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD)</strong>.
Students may use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.</p>
<h4><strong>The PLD Initiative</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –
the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also
enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they
navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p>

Keyboard Case (Rugged Combo 4).</p>

<h4><strong>4-year Apple Care+</strong></h4>
<p>Every iPad comes with one&nbsp;year of hardware repair coverage through
its one-year limited warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary technical
support. AppleCare+ extends your iPad, Apple&nbsp;Pencil and Apple-branded
iPad keyboard coverage to&nbsp;two years from your AppleCare+ purchase
date and adds up to two&nbsp;incidents of accidental damage protection
every 12&nbsp;months. Each incident is subject to a service&nbsp;fee of
S$68 for iPad and S$42 for Apple&nbsp;Pencil or Apple-branded iPad keyboard.</p>
<h4><strong>Intent to Purchase</strong></h4>
<p>A Parent Gateway (PG) notification with details on the procurement of
the PLD has also been sent to parents/ guardians. Please refer to the notification
for more information.</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians without Singpass and Parent Gateway can request for
the hardcopy letter via your child’s/ward’s form teacher.</p>
<h4><strong>After-school DMA Parent Options</strong></h4>
<p>Device Management Application (DMA) software is installed in students’
PLDs to provide a safer digital learning environment, and to prevent misuse
of the device. Parents/guardians can choose between these 3 options to
suit their preferences for managing the PLDs after school hours:</p>
